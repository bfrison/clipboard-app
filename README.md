# clipboard-app
A simple app that allows the user to modify the case of the text in clipboard, using an interface written in TkInter.
If both files are not placed in the same folder, the location of the .py file must be added to the system paths in the .pyw file.
To use the app, double click the .pyw file. Copy a text (ctrl-c on windows), click the desired case (upper, lower, title, etc.) and paste the text.
